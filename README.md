# predict_rain
To build a Machine Learning model which will predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow by studying past data.

#Data Set Description:
This data set contains around 145k observations on the daily weather conditions as observed from numerous Australian weather stations. The data set has around 24 features and we will be using 23 features (Predictor variables) to predict the target variable, which is, “RainTomorrow”.

This target variable (RainTomorrow) will store two values:

Yes: Denotes that it will rain tomorrow
No: Denotes it will not rain tomorrow
Therefore, this is clearly a classification problem. The Machine Learning model will classify the output into 2 classes, either YES or NO.
